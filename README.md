# Input Helper

Generic types and tools for unifying input libraries.

The main goal of Input Helper is to provide a set of common set of types representing generic input devices such as,
keyboards, mice, game-pads, ext.  This is to allow applications to write their input code against Input Helper, so they
can reuse input handling code across input libraries.

### Project Status

Input Helper is still in early alpha, so expect bugs, missing features, changing APIs, and other spooky stuff until
release 1.0.
